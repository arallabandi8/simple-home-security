# simple-home-security
An Arduino-based machine that alerts of break-ins using proximity.

## Introduction
Oftentimes when living with multiple people in the same house, there are times when you may not want anyone else to enter your roomâ€”especially when you are not there. As such, my main motivation for this was for that purpose: to keep others out of my room. However, while developing the system, I found that it could be easily repurposed into a simple home security system.\
As such, I created a security system with the following goals and features in mind:
* Detect movement at a specified distance and alert the user in some way.
* Play a sound to alert and warn the intruder.
* Change the display of the on-board LED matrix to an appropriate symbol.
* Write a message to the Arduino Serial Monitor whenever movement is detected, _logging the time it happens._

## Circuit
![Schematic of Home Security Circuit](circuit.svg)\
Above is a schematic of the circuit required, which is simple and able to be freely modified. The following components are used:
* Arduino Uno R4 WiFi (Uno R3 shown in schematic)
* Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR01)
* Piezo Buzzer
* 2x Resistors (Equivalent resistance)
